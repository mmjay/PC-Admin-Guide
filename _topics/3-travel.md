## During Travel
While traveling, you should always carry a copy of your Travel Authorization and your itinerary from SATO.
Keep all of your receipts.
If your itinerary changes for whatever reason while you are on your trip (for example: weather) you must contact SATO immediately. You can reach them at 202-692-1170. If it is after hours, this number will roll over to their emergency hotline. There should always be someone to answer the phone. At the bottom of your SATO itinerary is more contact information for SATO, and an individual reference number for your trip.
```
If you find yourself in a dangerous situation, you must immediately reach out to the appropriate authorities. Here is a link to the State Department webpage titled, "Emergencies Abroad." It has an Embassy Locator, and several other helpful resources.

## Travel Authorization form

## Travel Voucher form
You must submit a Travel Voucher within 5 days of returning from your trip. It is possible that you may not be reimbursed for certain expenses if you wait too long to submit your Travel Voucher.

Submit your Travel Voucher and all of your receipts to the Administrative Specialist, who will review for accuracy, and submit to the CAO.
CAO will submit signed Travel Voucher to Gap Travel, who will begin the process of reimbursement.
