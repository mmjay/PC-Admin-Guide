# Staff development
You can find the agency's training policy here:

- <span class="fa fa-file-word-o" markdown="0"></span>
[Manual Section 664 In-Service Staff Training](https://intranet.peacecorps.gov/pcmanual/_layouts/15/WopiFrame2.aspx?sourcedoc=/pcmanual/Documents/MS-664-Policy.docx&action=default)

## Training requests
Unless otherwise specified, all training requests, except requests for in-house training, will be initiated and approved via a completed SF-182. Any individual on staff who attends training without getting prior approval may be held liable for all costs associated with that training unless administrative error can be clearly demonstrated.

1. Identify training opportunities and discuss plan with your supervisor
2. Fill out <span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o" markdown="0"></span>
[SF-182 Authorization, Agreement and Certification of Training](https://in.peacecorps.gov/HQ/EA/SiteAssets/Templates/Training%20SF182.pdf?Web=1)
3. Submit the completed SF-182 to your supervisor for approval at <mark>Section D, Boxes 1a through 1e</mark>.
4. Submit the supervisor-approved SF-182 to the EA Admin team for CAO approval at <mark>Section E, Boxes 1a through 1e</mark>.
5. The EA Admin team is responsible for contacting the vendor, paying registration fees, reserving space, and ensuring necessary registration materials or forms are forwarded to the vendor. Please do not pay out-of-pocket for your training; the EA Admin team will use a government purchase card for payment.
6. When you are registered, you will receive a confirmation email from the EA Admin team and/or the vendor. You should also confirm your registration directly with the vendor. If you have not received a confirmation email, please contact the EA Admin team.

## Allowed expenses
The Peace Corps has the authority, contingent upon training needs and available funding, to pay all or any part of the expenses associated with approved training. The training must be related to current or anticipated future work assignments.  

Examples of allowable training expenses include course fees, conference registration fees, materials/textbooks, and travel expenses.

Training expenses must be authorized before an individual attends a training activity.  In rare circumstances, authorization to pay for training expenses may be approved retroactively when the approval process was not completed prior to the assignment of the employee to training because of administrative error.

## Travel to training site
It is strongly encouraged that you attend training within your duty station (i.e., Washington D.C. metro area). If you request to attend training outside your duty station, your supervisor and the CAO will consider the following when deciding whether to approve travel reimbursement:
- Availability of comparable trainings within your duty location (i.e., Washington D.C. metro area);
- Extenuating circumstances requiring travel; and,
- Availability of funds.

## Training approval

Training requests are approved contingent upon training need and available funding. Your supervisor and the CAO will consider the following when deciding whether to approve your training request:

- Availability of staff who are already trained but not being utilized;
- Degree of an individual’s need for training to acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform his or her current job or qualify for another position at an accelerated rate;
- Individual’s need to complete mandatory/required training;
- Potential of the individual for advancement, including his or her capability to learn skills and acquire knowledge and abilities needed in a new position;
- Extent to which the individual’s knowledge, skills, and abilities are likely to be improved by training;
- Length of time and degree to which the organization expects to benefit from the training;
- Training opportunities previously afforded the individual;
- The individual's own interest in and efforts to improve his or her work; and,
- Availability of funds.

## Individual development plan
An Individual Development Plan (IDP) is a personal action plan, jointly agreed to by you and your supervisor, that identifies your short and long-term career goals. An IDP also identifies the training and other developmental experiences needed to achieve these goals, for the benefit of the individual and organization, within a specified time frame.

IDPs are not mandatory but are strongly encouraged.

Here is a good guide to help create your IDP:

Here is a template IDP worksheet:

## Conferences
We can use office funds to pay for conference registration fees, if:

- The training request is approved by your supervisor and the CAO;
- The announced purpose of the conference is educational or instructional;
- The content of the conference is relevant to improving individual or organizational performance;
- The individual will derive developmental benefits from attending; and
- The individual will share knowledge obtained from the conference with others upon return to the job.
