# Purchasing
This section is a reference for External Affairs staff needing to place orders for services ≤$2,500 or supplies ≤$3,500.

Our department follows the agency's acquisition policies. You can find those policies here:

## Ordering supplies

Unless otherwise specified, all purchase requests will be initiated and approved via a completed Purchase Request form. Approved requested will be paid by the EA Admin team with a government purchase card.
1. Identify business need for supplies or services
2. Fill out <span class="fa fa-file-pdf-o" markdown="0"></span>
[Purchase Request form](https://in.peacecorps.gov/HQ/EA/SiteAssets/Templates/Purchase%20Request%20for%20Supplies.pdf?Web=1)
3. Submit the completed Purchase Request form to your supervisor for approval.
4. Submit the supervisor-approved Purchase Request form to the EA Admin team for CAO approval.
5. The EA Admin team is responsible for obligating funds and contacting the vendor for payment and/or to begin work. Do not instruct a vendor to begin work unless the EA Admin team has obligated funds (see Ratifications section below).
6. When the payment has been made, you will receive a confirmation email from the EA Admin team and/or the vendor. Please forward any paid receipts to the EA Admin team for recordkeeping.

## Unauthorized commitment/purchase
A purchase without an obligation is an unauthorized commitment. An obligation can only be made by staff with delegated authority to do so. If you do not have a government purchase card, or delegation of procurement authority, you do not have the authority to commit government funds or enter into an agreement. Please contact the CAO if you have any additional questions. Staff that make unauthorized purchases may be liable for the expenses incurred.

Unauthorized purchases may be ratified (and obligated) by a Contracting Officer if there are extenuating circumstances. Please coordinate with the CAO for any ratifications.
