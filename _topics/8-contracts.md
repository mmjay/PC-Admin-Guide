## COR responsibilities

## Contractor personnel security clearance
1. COR fills out & signs WAAF, gets Contractor to fill out OF306, then takes forms to Contracting Officer.
- COR asks the Contractor fill out FORM 306 (attached).  
- COR fills out the latest version of the WAAF (also attached).
- COR signs in the “Sponsor” field located about mid-page down the WAAF.

2. Contracting Officer signs/validates WAAF.  Then COR takes WAAF & OF306 to HR.
- COR takes the WAAF to Gwendolyn Harper in OACM, who verifies and validates COR/Contractor legitimacy with her signature in the  “Contracting Officer” field located about mid-page down the WAAF.
- COR then takes the 2 completed forms to HR.

3. HR initiates sponsorship.  HR then takes WAAF & OF306 TO SS/IPS.
- After Contracting Officer Gwendolyn signs, COR gives Form 306 and WAAF to HR, Melanie West, and leaves it with her.  She initiates the PIV Card Sponsorship in the GSA/USAccess system, and takes WAAF + FORM 306 down to SS/IPS.

4. SS/IPS takes WAAF – Clears & adjudicates WAAF.
- HR shepherds the WAAF down to Safety & Security/IPS (Daniel Goshorn-Maroney and Michelle Swanston) who performs security checks.  
- IPS informs COR if and when Contractor is cleared to report to work, adjudicates Contractor in USAccess, and validates the WAAF with signature.
- COR notifies staffing analyst in his or her office to update employment start/end dates in the PTS system.
- IPS takes complete WAAF to EMPS.   

5. SS/EMPS reviews/validates WAAF – issues badge.
- SS/IPS takes WAAF to SS/EMPS front desk (Krystal McLellan and John McIntire), where it sits on file until the Contractor’s first day of work.  
- On the Contractor’s first day, EMPS verifies PTS data and Personnel Security validation on the WAAF before issuing a Temp badge for the Contractor to use until his/her PIV Card ships to HQ.
