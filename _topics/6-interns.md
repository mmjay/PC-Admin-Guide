## Internships
Our office follows M/HRM's procedures for student internships. You can reference that document here:

## Can we offer paid internships?
We are not able to process paid internships under the hiring freeze. Unpaid internships are not affected. This guide will be updated as information becomes available.

## Advertising internship opportunities
Managers should consider posting internship openings on local university job boards. Common schools includes GWU, AU, and Georgetown. For help with posting an internship opening, please see the EA Admin team for additional information.

Peace Corps' only internship advertisement can be found here:

HRM files internship applications in <u>S:\@Agency_All\Intern and Student Programs</u> as they are received.
