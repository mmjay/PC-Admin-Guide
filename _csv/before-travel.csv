4,Traveler,"SATO, Admin Specialist, CAO","Start creating your Travel Authorization form. You can find the TA form, instructions for how to fill out your form, and an example TA here. Note: SATO will let you know when the quote they send you needs to be ticketed (purchased) by. If SATO recommends a non-refundable ticket, it must be purchased within 48 hours of receiving the quote. This means that you must complete and submit your TA within 48 hours of receiving the quote from SATO in order to book the itinerary that they send you."
5,Transportation,SATO,"After receiving your Travel Authorization, a Travel Specialist will record your TA and send it to The Chief of Transportation to approve. The Chief of Transportation then sends your Travel Authorization to the department's Obligation Recorder, who then obligates the authorized funds for your trip. Your approved Travel Authorization is then sent to another Transportation Specialist, who will file it in your Transportation folder, found here. The Travel Specialist should notify you when they do this. They will also send it to SATO, who will purchase your flight/train/hotel/etc. SATO will reach out to you directly with your itinerary."
6,Transportation,"Traveler, CAO","Things to keep in mind: -Transportation will approve your TA if everything is correct. Most standard TAs will be approved if filled out correctly. If your per-diem has been entered incorrectly, Transportation will adjust it for you. -Transportation will only pre-approve expenses for the cost of those expenses at TDY location. For example, if you decide to stay at a hotel in another town outside of where you will be performing your official duties, you will only be reimbursed the TDY lodging rate for the town you will actually be working in. -If the cost of the trip exceeds the standard cost of trips to this location, Transportation will deny the authorization, or notify the Approving Official of any changes to the authorization."
7,Traveler,"SATO, CDO","If you are traveling outside of the country, you may or may not need to complete these steps: If you are visitng a Post, you should always reach out to the CDO of the country that you are going to.
