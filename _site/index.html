<h2 id="unauthorized-commitmentpurchase">Unauthorized commitment/purchase</h2>
<p>A purchase without an obligation is an unauthorized commitment. An obligation can only be made by staff with delegated authority to do so. If you do not have a government purchase card, or delegation of procurement authority, you do not have the authority to commit government funds or enter into an agreement. Please contact the CAO if you have any additional questions. Staff that make unauthorized purchases may be liable for the expenses incurred.</p>

<p>Unauthorized purchases may be ratified (and obligated) by a Contracting Officer if there are extenuating circumstances. Please coordinate with the CAO for any ratifications.</p>

<p>Examples of allowable training expenses include course fees, conference registration fees, materials/textbooks, and travel expenses.</p>

<p>It is strongly encouraged that you attend training within your duty station (i.e., Washington D.C. metro area). If you request to attend training outside your duty station, your supervisor and the CAO will consider the following when deciding whether to approve travel reimbursement:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Availability of comparable trainings within your duty location (i.e., Washington D.C. metro area);</li>
  <li>Extenuating circumstances requiring travel; and,</li>
  <li>Availability of funds.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Availability of staff who are already trained but not being utilized;</li>
  <li>Degree of an individual’s need for training to acquire the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform his or her current job or qualify for another position at an accelerated rate;</li>

<h2 id="individual-development-plan">Individual development plan</h2>
<p>An Individual Development Plan (IDP) is a personal action plan, jointly agreed to by you and your supervisor, that identifies your short and long-term career goals. An IDP also identifies the training and other developmental experiences needed to achieve these goals, for the benefit of the individual and organization, within a specified time frame.</p>

<p>IDPs are not mandatory but are strongly encouraged.</p>

<p>Here is a good guide to help create your IDP:</p>

<h2 id="conferences">Conferences</h2>
<p>We can use office funds to pay for conference registration fees, if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The training request is approved by your supervisor and the CAO;</li>
  <li>The announced purpose of the conference is educational or instructional;</li>
  <li>The content of the conference is relevant to improving individual or organizational performance;</li>
  <li>The individual will derive developmental benefits from attending; and</li>
  <li>The individual will share knowledge obtained from the conference with others upon return to the job.</li>

<h2 id="cor-certification">COR certification</h2>
<p>Training is required to receive Contracting Officer’s Representative certification. COR Level I requires 8 hours of training and no experience. COR Level II requires 40 hours of training and 1 year of previous COR experience. COR training must be registered and recorded in the FAITAS system:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="fa fa-external-link-square"></span> <a href="https://faitas.army.mil/Faitas/External/Login">Federal Acquisition Institute</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can check your certification status by navigating to <strong>Manage Career&gt;Continuous Learning&gt;My Points Requests</strong> within the FAITAS system.</p>

<p>There are continuous learning requirements to maintain COR certification. It varies depending on your COR certification level. Here is the governmentwide guidance regarding CLPs:</p>
